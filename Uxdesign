    This project is a reproduction of the first parallax project with a slight twist. Instead of using pictures the project uses Typographic images to create a well known phrase. 
    This project uses three colors:
    <div class="colors">
      Black: #00000
      White: #fffff
      Green: 00f10a
      
      
  </div>
    
  There are two sections to this project. The top section includes the footer(which is the cover) and the bottom section include the images which will overlay the cover
